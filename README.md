*this is the backend repo, the frontend has a separate repo*

**CodeCollab**
A collaborative code editor in the browser allows multiple users to join a room from various devices, enabling them to write code or fix bugs in real-time while the code is synced across all users.

**Technologies Used** :
React, Nodejs, Express, PostgreSQL, Redux, JWT, Socket.io, Supabase

**Usage** :
* Sign up for an account (may take some time, as the Supabase database undergoes a cold start if it hasn't been accessed for a while)
* Create a room
* Invite new users via the room ID
* Enjoy coding or fixing bugs!

**Future Feature Ideas** :
* Implement a compiler to compile the written code.
* Add an AI coding assistant which gives auto-complete code suggestions.

Contributing: Contributions are welcome from anyone interested in helping to improve the application.
